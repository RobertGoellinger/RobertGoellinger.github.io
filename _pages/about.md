I am currently studying to become a mechanical engineer at RWTH Aachen, but I am most passionate about control theory and programming. 

I started off coding in MATLAB by teaching the courses "Introduction to MATLAB" and "Simulation using MATLAB and Simulink" for the IT Center RWTH Aachen. 

Afterwards I completed an internship at BMW as a software developer at the Vehicle Dynamics Division. I mainly worked on the MBSE Toolchain, the main tool used at BMW to generate C-Code for ECUs from Simulink models. In this capacity I gained experience working with JAVA, Python and Bazel. In addition I got exposed to developing and maintaining large CI/CD systems.

Addionately I worked as a MATLAB software developer on the medical imaging software "ImageRefiner" for the group of Prof. Dr. Ostendorf at Uniklinik RWTH Aachen University.
