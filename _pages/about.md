I recently completed my Master in Automation Engineering at RWTH Aachen University, Germany focusing on the application of modern control approaches such as Model-Predictive Control and Norm-Optimal Iterative Learning Control at the [Institute for Automatic Control](https://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/). 
My topic there was the Automatic Parameterization of a Norm-optimal Iterative Learning Cavity Pressure Control in Plastic Injection Molding. 
Currently I am staying in Joinville, Brasil for a research stay at [Laborat√≥rio de Sistemas Embarcados](https://lselab.ufsc.br/) hosted by Prof. Dr. Gian Berkenbrock.
My research here focuses on the usage of Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the usage as process models in model-based controllers.
Previously I completed my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University. 

I started off coding in MATLAB by teaching the courses "Introduction to MATLAB" and "Simulation using MATLAB and Simulink" for the IT Center RWTH Aachen. 
Afterwards I completed an internship at BMW as a software developer at the Vehicle Dynamics Division. 
I mainly worked on the MBSE Toolchain, the main tool used at BMW to generate C-Code for ECUs from Simulink models. 
In this capacity I gained experience working with JAVA, Python and Bazel. In addition I got exposed to developing and maintaining large CI/CD systems.
Addionately I worked as a MATLAB software developer on the medical imaging software "ImageRefiner" for the group of Prof. Dr. Ostendorf at Uniklinik RWTH Aachen University. 
At the Institute for Plastics Processing I focussed on the deployment of a large process optimization platform using Docker containers.
